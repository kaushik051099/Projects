# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository! This repository contains various Jupyter Notebooks showcasing my work in data analysis, predictive modeling, and natural language processing. Each notebook presents a unique project that demonstrates my skills and knowledge in these areas.

## Projects

### 1. Understanding Magazine Subscription Behavior
- **File:** `understanding-magazine-subscription-behavior.ipynb`
- **Description:** This project analyzes factors influencing magazine subscription behavior. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling techniques to gain insights into customer preferences.

### 2. Stroke and Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression
- **File:** `stroke-and-cancer-prediction-logistic-regression.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook presents a predictive modeling project focused on stroke and cancer prediction using logistic regression. It emphasizes model development, evaluation, and recommendations based on the findings.

### 3. NLP with NLTK: Analysis of "Emma" by Jane Austen
- **File:** `nlp-with-nltk-analysis-of-emma-by-jane-austen.ipynb`
- **Description:** In this project, I perform a natural language processing analysis of Jane Austen's "Emma" using the NLTK library. The analysis focuses on key themes, character interactions, and sentiment analysis within the text.

### 4. Inferential Statistics and Regression Testing
- **File:** `inferential-statistics-and-regression-testing.ipynb`
- **Description:** This notebook explores inferential statistics and regression testing methods. It includes statistical tests, model evaluation, and interpretation of results to draw meaningful conclusions from the data.
